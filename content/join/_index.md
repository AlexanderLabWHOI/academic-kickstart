I am eager to build a diverse group of researchers who are united by their interest in microbial oceanography, genomics, and phytoplankton. Please do not hesitate to get in touch if you are interested in joining the research group!

## Undergraduate students

I can host students through organized programs at WHOI, such as the [Summer Student Fellows (SSF)](https://www.whoi.edu/main/summer-student-fellowship) Program or the [Semester at WHOI (SAW)](http://www.whoi.edu/semester-at-whoi/) Program. Please refer to these websites for more information and feel free to indicate your interest in joining the lab.

## Graduate students

If you are interested in phytoplankton ecology or working on computational approaches to enable our understanding of marine microbial systems, you may be a good fit in the lab. Generally, I look for students who have a background in Biology, Chemistry, Computational Biology, or a closely related areas and have taken classes that might include: genetics, genomics, computational biology, biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, genetics, statistics, calculus, organic chemistry, and/or computer science. However, please don't let this list stop you from contacting me!  

Prospective graduate students should apply to the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program](http://mit.whoi.edu/) in Biological Oceanography.

If you think that our research sounds exciting and are interested in applying to the Joint Program, please email me (Harriet) directly.

## Postdocs

If you are interested in joining the lab please contact Harriet directly. WHOI has an excellent and competitive [Postdoctoral Scholar Program](https://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8021). Applications are due in September.
