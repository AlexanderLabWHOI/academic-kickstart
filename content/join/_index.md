## Undergraduate students

I am open to hosting students through organized programs at WHOI, such as the [Summer Student Fellows (SSF)](https://www.whoi.edu/main/summer-student-fellowship) Program or the [Semester at WHOI (SAW)](http://www.whoi.edu/semester-at-whoi/) Program. Please refer to these websites for more information and feel free to indicate your interest in joining the lab.

## Graduate students

If you are looking to work on computational approaches to better understand marine microbial systems and , you may be a good fit in the lab. Prospective graduate students should apply to the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program](http://mit.whoi.edu/) in Biological Oceanography. Interested students should contact Harriet directly. Generally speaking, competitive applicants to the Joint Program will have a GPA of 3.5 or higher. I am looking for candidates who have a background in Biology, Chemistry, Computational Biology, or a closely related area. I would like to see evidence of a rigorous science foundation with courses such as genetics, genomics, computational biology, biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, genetics, calculus, organic chemistry, and/or computer science. I strongly advise all eligible students to apply for fellowship programs.

## Postdocs

If you are interested in joining the lab please contact Harriet directly. WHOI has an excellent and competitive [Postdoctoral Scholar Program](https://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8021). Applications are due in September.
