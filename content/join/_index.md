## Undergraduate students

I will host students through organized programs at WHOI, such as the [Summer Student Fellows (SSF)](https://www.whoi.edu/main/summer-student-fellowship) Program or the [Semester at WHOI (SAW)](http://www.whoi.edu/semester-at-whoi/) Program. Please refer to these websites for more information and feel free to indicate your interest in joining the lab.

For the summer of 2019, I am recruiting an SSF to work on a joint computational project between my lab and Maria Pachiadaki's lab. You can find the details of the project [here](http://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=149016&tid=7342&cid=272129).

## Graduate students

If you are interested in phytoplankton ecology or working on computational approaches to enable our understanding of marine microbial systems, you may be a good fit in the lab. Generally, I look for students who have a background in Biology, Chemistry, Computational Biology, or a closely related area and have taken classes that might include: genetics, genomics, computational biology, biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, genetics, statistics, calculus, organic chemistry, and/or computer science. However, please don't let this list stop you from contacting Harriet! 

Prospective graduate students should apply to the [MIT-WHOI Joint Program](http://mit.whoi.edu/) in Biological Oceanography. 

If you are interested in applying and think that our research sounds interesting, please email Harriet directly. 

## Postdocs

If you are interested in joining the lab please contact Harriet directly. WHOI has an excellent and competitive [Postdoctoral Scholar Program](https://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8021). Applications are due in September.
