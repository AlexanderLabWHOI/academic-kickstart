Coccolithophores, a group of calcifying marine phytoplankton within the phylum Haptophyta, play a significant role in marine biogeochemical cycles, particularly in those of carbon and sulfur. *Emiliania huxleyi* is one of the most abundant extant coccolithophore species in the ocean, typified by its cosmopolitan distribution and ability to form large blooms. Intra-specific variability in physiology (e.g. enzymatic rates, morphology, growth rates) of *E. huxleyi* has long been known in cultured isolates. The capacity for this variability was revealed through the genome sequencing of many *E. huxleyi* strains, the results of which suggested that *E. huxleyi* has a ‘pan genome,’ with gene content varying across strains. Intensive study of another ecologically significant taxa with a pan genome, the cyanobacteria *Prochlorococcus*, has connected the variability of the pan genome to its niche separation and biogeographical distribution. Similar to *Prochlorococcus*, intra-specific genomic variability may underpin the success of *E. huxleyi* across diverse environmental conditions and underlie its observed physiological variability. Here we are combining a series of genomic, computational field surveys, and laboratory-based experiments designed to identify the function of the pan genome in *E. huxleyi* ecology and biogeography. Through this project, we will address the questions:

1. Is there structure to the variable gene content across strains in the pan genome of *E. huxleyi*?
2. Does the environment select for particular strains of *E. huxleyi* based on the content of the variable portion of the pan genome?
3. Does the composition of the variable gene set determine strain success under shifting environmental conditions?
