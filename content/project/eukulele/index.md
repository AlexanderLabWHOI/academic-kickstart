Easy, accurate classification of the taxonomy of microbial eukaryotes in the environment is a persistent challenge. For metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data, annotation is imperfect, because genomic references for organisms isolated from the environment are lacking. By leveraging experimental transcriptomic references, we have designed a tool to estimate the taxonomy of marine microbial eukaryotes. The tool is a flexible and modular way to leverage the expanding amount of omics data on environmentally-isolated microbial eukaryotes in order to better annotate multi-organism omics datasets (meta-omics). The freely-available tool is implemented as a Python package and installable via both `pip` and `conda`.
