The [Bio-GO-SHIP](http://biogoship.org/) program aims to integrate the latest biological observing technologies into the Global Ocean Ship-based Hydrographic Investigation Program (GO-SHIP, http://go-ship.org/). GO-SHIP runs a global repeat-section effort, wherein reference sections that transect major ocean regions are sampled every decade to observe global changes. Bio-GO-SHIP measurements will include optical, flow cytometric, metagenomic and metatranscriptomic, and particulate sampling. Compared to previous global ocean sequencing efforts, Bio-GO-SHIP will sample biological parameters at high spatial and vertical resolution, with ‘omic samples being taken approximately every degree, or approximately 26.5km on average between samples. My group is focused on the collection, sequencing, and preliminary assembly data product curation of the ‘omic dataset in conjunction with Adam Martiny’s lab-- with my lab taking the lead on the eukaryotic component.
