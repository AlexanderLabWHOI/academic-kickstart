abstract = "Populations of nitrogen‐fixing cyanobacteria in the genus *Trichodesmium* are critical to ocean ecosystems, yet predicting patterns of *Trichodesmium* distribution and their role in ocean biogeochemistry is an ongoing challenge. This may, in part, be due to differences in the physiological ecology of *Trichodesmium* species, which are not typically considered independently in field studies. In this study, the abundance of the two dominant *Trichodesmium* clades (Clade I and Clade III) was investigated during a survey at Station ALOHA in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) using a clade‐specific qPCR approach. While Clade I dominated the *Trichodesmium* community, Clade III abundance was >50% in some NPSG samples, in contrast to the western North Atlantic where Clade III abundance was always <10%. Clade I populations were distributed down to depths >80 m, while Clade III populations were only observed in the mixed layer and found to be significantly correlated with depth and temperature. These data suggest active niche partitioning of *Trichodesmium* species from different clades, as has been observed in other cyanobacteria. Tracking the distribution and physiology of *Trichodesmium* spp. would contribute to better predictions of the physiological ecology of this biogeochemically important genus in the present and future ocean."
