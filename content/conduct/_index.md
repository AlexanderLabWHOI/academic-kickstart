In addition to adhering to [WHOI's Code of Conduct](http://www.whoi.edu/website/institution-policy/index?ct=901&cid=1582), all members of the lab and visitors to the lab are expected to agree with the following code of conduct. We will enforce this code as needed. We expect cooperation from all members to help ensuring a safe and productive environment for everyone.

The lab is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof). **We do not tolerate harassment of lab members in any form.** Sexual language and imagery is generally not appropriate for any lab venue, including lab meetings, presentations, or discussions.  (However, do note that as the lab is focused on biological matters, work-related discussions of animal reproduction etc. *are* appropriate).

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Members asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact Harriet Alexander immediately. If Harriet is the cause of your concern or you are not comfortable speaking with her please see the [WHOI's Code of Conduct reporting procedure](http://www.whoi.edu/website/institution-policy/index?ct=901&cid=1582#4) for alternative options.
