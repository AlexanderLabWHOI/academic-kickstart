# About the lab

Our lab focuses on the application of computational approaches to oceanographic questions. We use a combination of culture- and field-based studies to better understand the biogeochemical functioning and physiological ecology of eukaryotic plankton in a changing ocean. Topics of interest include the maintenance of genetic diversity in planktonic populations and the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning.

We also aim to make research done in this lab openly available and reproducible. We also work to share and teach these approaches to other researchers.
