Kevin Rice is a senior undergraduate at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, studying systems biochemistry. He has a particular interest in microbial ecology, bioinformatics, biological oceanography and ecological modeling. His previous research projects include understanding the function of rare taxa in the *Daphnia magna* microbiome, as well as quantifying bacterial DMSP synthesis potential.

Kevin is looking forward to learning more about oceanography and genomics in the Alexander lab!
