Laura Blum is an undergraduate Biology major at Middlebury College. In the past she has enjoyed research on developing metabarcoding methods for detecting invasive aquatic plants as well as characterizing reactive oxygen species dynamics on coral reefs.  She is excited to be exploring marine microbial ecology using metagenomics with Harriet Alexander and Maria Pachiadaki at WHOI. She plans to keep studying amazing microbes and to explore the field of origin of life research in the future.
