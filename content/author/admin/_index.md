Our lab focuses on the application of computational approaches to oceanographic questions. We use a combination of culture- and field-based studies to better understand the biogeochemical functioning and physiological ecology of eukaryotic plankton in a changing ocean. Topics of interest include the maintenance of genetic diversity in planktonic populations and the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning.

We aim to make research done in this lab openly available and reproducible, and work to share these approaches with other researchers.

Interested in [joining the lab](/join)?
