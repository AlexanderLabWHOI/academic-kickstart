Miah Manning is a Ph.D. student through the MIT-WHOI Joint Program. She has a B.A. in Biological Sciences from Rutgers University-New Brunswick. She is part of the Alexander lab, studying phytoplankton ecology and genomics in the context of harmful algal blooms (HABs). Miah's past research includes studying phytoplankton composition changes along the West Antarctic Peninsula (WAP) as part of the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research Project (Pal-LTER). She also studied the photophysiological response of Karenia brevis, the algae associated with Florida Red Tides, to bloom mitigation compounds at the Mote Marine Laboratory.
