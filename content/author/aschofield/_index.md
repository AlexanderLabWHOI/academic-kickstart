Alese is currently pursuing a degree in Biology from Massasoit Community College. A lifelong leaner and science-lover, her studies have spanned a variety of subjects, including how urbanization impacts native pollinators; community outreach through a floating classroom to encourage children to engage with the marine world around them; and most recently, has begun to study the effect of rising oceanic temperatures on bacterial vitamin-B12 metabolism via Altermonas macleodii and Ruegeria pomeryoi.

Alese is excited about collaborating with an innovative group of scientist, and is always looking forward to exploring that next big quesiton.
