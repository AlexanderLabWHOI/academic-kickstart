I am heading to Ocean Sciences Meeting next week in San Diego along with [Laura Blum](/authors/lblum/), an undergraduate researcher doing her thesis research with [Maria Pachiadaki](https://twitter.com/microbiaki), [Erin Eggleston](https://twitter.com/EggErin), and myself. We have two presentations (that are bookending the meeting --  Monday and Friday) that are both related to work we have been doing looking at MAGs from the larger size fraction metagenomic datasets generated as part of the Tara Expedition.  

#### **Microbial drivers of nitrogen metabolism: Searching Tara Oceans metagenomes**
**Laura Blum**, Erin Eggleston, Maria Pachiadaki, & Harriet Alexander <br> Poster# MM14A-0283  <br> Monday 17 February 2020 16:00 - 18:00

#### **Eukaryotic genome discovery: Scalable and automated retrieval of eukaryotic metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) from a global-scale dataset**

**Harriet Alexander** &  Sarah K Hu <br> Session# OB53C: *Toward BioGeoSCAPES: Exploring Molecular Drivers of Ocean Metabolism and Biogeochemistry* <br> Friday 21 February 2020 14:30 - 14:45, SDCC - 2, UL
