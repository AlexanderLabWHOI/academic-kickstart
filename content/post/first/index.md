Two months ago, I started in the Biology Department at the [Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution](whoi.edu) as an Assistant Scientist. The processes has been otherworldly. Suddenly I find myself the steward of my own ship (read: lab). My emotional state seems to oscillate between excited exhilaration and existential terror (*O* 3 kHz). I have spent the last 11 (or more) years working towards this very moment-- so it is surreal to have officially arrived. And now... what? Grants, papers, setting up a wet lab, navigating tenure, defining my scientific brand?

One thing I would like to practice more than I have during previous career stages is making writing more of a habit. Voicing myself in a public sphere has always made me nervous (reference that time in first grade when I got a nosebleed while leading the class in the pledge of allegiance). Be it giving a scientific talk, speaking up in a meeting or seminar, or tweeting (oh hey, you, follow me [@nekton4plankton](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=nekton4plankton)), I have to push by the jitters and psych myself up a bit.

So, consider this blog my attempt to habituate myself to making my thoughts more public. Topics to be covered will likely include: science, new PI life, computational blunders and wins, and life in a small, science-y fishing village.
